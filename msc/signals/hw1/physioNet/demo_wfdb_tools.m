% this is a slight hack to make sure the 'util' dir. is included in
% the path before we proceed; this is necessary when this script is
% launched as the web-start installer finishes, but the matlab path
% wasn't set up properly -- in that case, we execute with the
% dir. holding this script as the current working dir., so
% that we can still run it; but we need the 'util' subdir., too.
