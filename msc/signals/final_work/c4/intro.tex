When we move into a discrete time domain, the Fourier Transform equivalent
in this domain is called the DTFT or Discrete Time Fourier Transform
which is defined as \cite{kamen2000fundamentals}:

\begin{equation}
\mathfrak{F}\{ x[n] \} = \displaystyle\sum_{- \infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j \omega n} = X(\omega)
\label{eq:c41}
\end{equation}
