abstract = {Photonic technology is becoming an increasingly attractive solution to the problems facing today's electronic chip-scale interconnection networks. Recent progress in silicon photonics research has enabled the demonstration of all the necessary optical building blocks for creating extremely high-bandwidth density and energy-efficient links for on-chip and off-chip communications. From the feasibility and architecture perspective however, photonics represents a dramatic paradigm shift from traditional electronic network designs due to fundamental differences in how electronics and photonics function and behave. As a result of these differences, new modeling and analysis methods must be employed in order to properly realize a functional photonic chip-scale interconnect design. In this paper, we present a methodology for characterizing and modeling fundamental photonic building blocks which can subsequently be combined to form full photonic network architectures. We also describe a set of tools which can be utilized to assess the physical-layer and system-level performance properties of a photonic network. The models and tools are integrated in a novel open-source design and simulation environment. We present a case study of two different photonic networks-on-chip to demonstrate how our improved understanding and modeling of the physical-layer details of photonic communications can be used to better understand the system-level performance impact.},

abstract = {Photonic interconnection networks have recently been proposed as a replacement to conventional electronic network-on-chip solutions in delivering the ever increasing communication requirements of future chip multiprocessors. While photonics offers superior bandwidth density, lower latencies, and improvements in energy efficiency over electronics, the photonic network designs that can leverage these benefits cannot be easily derived by simply mimicking electronic layouts. In fact, proper implementations of photonic interconnects will require the careful consideration of a variety new physical-layer metrics and design requirements that did not exist with electronics. Here, we review some of the currently proposed designs for chip-scale photonic interconnection networks, the design methodologies required to produce viable network topologies, and a simulation environment, called PhoenixSim, that we have developed to accurately model and study those metrics and designs.},

abstract = {Interconnect power is dynamic power dissipation due to switching of interconnection capacitances. This paper describes the characterization of interconnect power in a state-of-the-art high-performance microprocessor designed for power efficiency. The analysis showed that interconnect power is over 50 \% of the dynamic power. Over 90 \% of the interconnect power is consumed by only 10 \% of the interconnections. Relations of interconnect power to wire length distribution and hierarchy level of nets were examined. In light of the results, a router’s algorithms were modified, to use larger wire spacing and minimal length routing for the high power consuming interconnects. The power-aware router algorithm was tested on synthesized blocks, demonstrating average saving of 14 \% in the dynamic power consumption without timing degradation or area increase. The results demonstrate the obtainable benefits of tuning physical design algorithms to save power.},
